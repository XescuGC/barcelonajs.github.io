<p>I want to talk about Hermes. This is an in-progress concept on how <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bpedro/asynchronous-microservices-in-nodejs">asynchronous microservices architecture (based on message brokers, such as RabbitMQ)</a> could also be used in frontend. The fact of using Node.js for microservices allow us to share code with frontend, but a new concept is being investigated about <em>sharing infrastructure</em>. At a glance, you could see you can do a backend without a REST API, event-based (instead of request-based) and a <a href="http://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/">backend for frontend</a> approach. Curious about it? Join us to learn and discuss about it.</p>
