<p>Me and a friend @jvlucic are looking to give some talks in the BCNJS meetups if you are interested. Specifically it would be two talks ( we are not sure if both should be in the same session or separate ), one would be for teaching basic Redux and the second for more advanced Redux #9:</p>
<p>This would be this gist of it (pending changes):</p>
<p><strong>The Basic of Redux:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An introduction to reducers.</li>
<li>Managing the state as an inmutable data.</li>
<li>The benefits of an unique state tree.</li>
<li>Dispatching actions and modifying the state.</li>
<li>Time travel / Testing</li>
<li>Introduction to middlewares and store enhancers</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find this interesting!</p>
